/*
 * S5LBox — the five physical buttons, and the level-sensitive GPIO lines they
 * arrive on.
 *
 * The property that matters most here is not that a bit changes. It is that
 * NOTHING IS ASSERTED AT REST. Two of the five buttons are wired active low, so
 * the pin block's power-on zero is a volume key held down, and the moment the
 * guest programs INTLEVEL for a level-sensitive line that becomes an interrupt
 * storm on a machine where nobody has touched anything. Several tests below
 * exist only to make that fail loudly.
 *
 * The second is that a press and a release each produce EXACTLY ONE interrupt,
 * through the guest's own auto-flip sequence rather than through anything this
 * model invents. test_the_guests_own_press_and_release_sequence() replays
 * AppleS5L8900XGPIOIC's real instruction order — configure, enable, then per
 * interrupt: read status, flip INTLEVEL, run the handler, acknowledge — and a
 * model that gets the order wrong either loses the release or rebuilds run71's
 * livelock on five more lines.
