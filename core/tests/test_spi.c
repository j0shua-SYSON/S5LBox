/*
 * iOS3-VM — S5L8900 SPI controller focused tests.
 *
 * The property that matters most here is not that a byte moves. It is that the
 * interrupt this controller raises is one the stock handler will act on: the
 * handler body reads STATUS, and when the receive-level field is zero it
 * returns without acknowledging anything, so nothing calls finishTransfer and
 * nothing calls commandWakeup. A model that raises the line over an empty
 * receive FIFO reproduces the unbounded IOCommandGate::commandSleep() the
 * multitouch kext has been stuck in rather than ending it, and would look
 * entirely healthy from every other angle. Several tests below exist only to
 * make that state representable and distinguishable.
