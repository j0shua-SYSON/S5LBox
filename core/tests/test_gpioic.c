/*
 * iOS3-VM — S5L8900 GPIO interrupt controller and GPIO pin block tests.
 *
 * The property that matters most here is not that a register stores a word. It
 * is that the ONE line the guest has already armed reaches the CPU: run59
 * measured this controller's group-4 enable holding 0x08000000, which is bit
 * 27, which is line 155, which is the multi-touch attention line — and the
 * whole chain from that bit to cpu.irq_line runs through two numbers that are
 * easy to get wrong and impossible to notice being wrong. 155 must decode as
 * group 4 bit 27 with a stride of 32, not as a pin; and group 4 must cascade to
 * VIC line 2, the fifth entry of a DESCENDING device-tree array. Get either one
 * wrong and every register still reads back correctly, every count still
 * increments, and a touch simply never arrives. Several tests below exist only
 * to make those two numbers fail loudly.
