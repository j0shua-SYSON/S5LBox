/*
 * S5LBox — AppleMultitouchZ2SPI's device: focused tests.
 *
 * One property dominates this file: the answer to isInHBPP() (0xc0441008,
 * vtable slot 0x4d0 off base 0xc0449f40). finishStarting() at 0xc0442670 keeps
 * the driver attached only on a TRUE. attemptToBootloadDevice() at 0xc04414c4
 * pushes 54,156 bytes of firmware on a TRUE and logs "not in HBPP, so skipping
 * bootload" on a FALSE. The two probes are BYTE-IDENTICAL on the wire, so the
 * discrimination is one monotonic bit and four designs for it have now been
 * wrong -- twice in ways that only showed up in an 18-minute boot.
 *
 * What separates them is the reset line's LEVEL: resetDevice clocks a dummy
 * 16-byte transfer sending the same `1A A1 18 E1...` while the line is
 * asserted and discards the answer, then releases the line and probes. Held in
 * reset the part drives nothing, so the dummy cannot spend the claim. Three
 * tests below exist only to make each past mistake fail loudly:
 * test_the_dummy_transfer_is_not_observable, test_reset_does_not_rearm,
 * and test_the_whole_bring_up_sequence.
 *
 * The tests build the driver's own probe bytes, frames and acceptance tests,
 * transcribed from the disassembly rather than reused from the model -- a
 * model checked against itself checks nothing.

 * 54,156 octets moved by ch5 with the packet headers inside that stream -- so
