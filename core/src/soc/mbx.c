/*
 * S5LBox -- measured PowerVR MBX register block and its first decoded 2D copy.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. QuartzCore composites every pixel on the CPU in this VM,
 * and that software path is 40.2% of the instructions in a home-screen swipe.
 * It is not the path a real iPhone takes: CA::WindowServer::MBXServer DEFAULTS
 * to the MBX2D hardware path and only falls back when its IOKit connection is
 * missing. The connection is missing because com.apple.driver.AppleMBX never
 * finishes starting, and it never finishes starting because it waits on a
 * register this VM did not have. So the software rasteriser is not something
 * to high-level-emulate around; it is a symptom of an unmodelled device, and
 * tools/ios3_hle.c's rule is that a model gap gets modelled.
 *
 * WHAT THE DRIVER ACTUALLY WAITS FOR, taken from its own code rather than
 * guessed -- the same standard core/src/soc/power.c held itself to. The reset
 * routine at AppleMBX+0xb400 (0xc0783440) reads:
 *
 *     mov  r2, #1
 *     ldr  r1, [pc, #0x2c]        ; r1 = 0x1020, from the literal pool
 *     blx  ip                     ; write(obj, 0x1020, 1)
 *   loop:
 *     ldr  r0, [r4, #4]
 *     ldr  r1, [pc, #0x14]        ; r1 = 0x1020 again
 *     blx  r5                     ; r0 = read(obj, 0x1020)
 *     tst  r0, #0x10000           ; bit 16
 *     beq  loop                   ; spin while it is CLEAR
 *     mov  r3, #1
 *     strb r3, [r4, #1]           ; mark the device ready, return
 *
 * So: write 1 to 0x1020, then spin until bit 16 reads back set. That is a
 * reset request and its completion acknowledgement, and it is the whole of
 * what this file has evidence for.
 *
 * THE EVIDENCE THAT THE ADDRESS IS RIGHT is independent of the disassembly.
 * r225 ran with the nub matched and counted accesses per page: 0x3b000000
 * took 2 reads and 3 writes, and 0x3b001000 took 157,441,382 reads and 9
 * writes. Offset 0x1020 from the block base falls in the second page, which
 * is the page that spun. Two instruments, one conclusion.
 *
 * WHAT THIS STILL IS NOT. It is not a general PowerVR renderer. The later
 * command consumer implements one packet family whose producer, bit fields,
 * MMU tables and pixels have all been recovered from the shipped binaries and
 * exact cold snapshots. Premultiplied source-over, filtered unity sprites and
 * one uniformly minified form are decoded; unknown formats, perspective,
 * nonuniform scaling, blend equations and geometry are rejected without
 * completion. Everything else remains a fresh question to
 * answer the same way -- observe it, read its producer, then model it. A
 * driver that needs an unknown operation must stop loudly instead of quietly
 * proceeding on fabricated pixels.

/*
 * THE INSTRUMENT FOR THE NEXT STALL, and the file predicted needing it: "if the
 * driver later reads the region and depends on an effect that never happened,
 * it will stall or complain at a NEW address". Finding that address is a
 * counting problem, and the existing device log cannot count it -- it keeps the
 * FIRST S5L_DEVLOG accesses, and r225 measured 157 million reads on one page,
 * so the log is full of the reset spin before the driver has even started.
 *
 * A per-offset histogram answers it directly: whatever the driver is spinning
 * on is whatever has a count in the millions once the reset handshake is done.
 * The ring holds the last few accesses so the spin's SHAPE is visible too --
 * one offset read forever is a poll, a repeating group is a command sequence.
 *
 * This is deliberately file-static rather than a member of s5l_mbx_t. It is a
 * diagnostic and not machine state, so it must not enter a snapshot; keeping it
 * out of the struct also keeps sizeof(s5l_mbx_t), its SNAP_SIZE_GUARD and
 * SNAPSHOT_VERSION untouched, and a version bump would invalidate every
 * existing snapshot including one being captured while this was written.
 *
 * It counts and prints. It changes no value the guest can observe.

 * The command-copy helper advances a software cursor, but the actual submit
 * boundary is a fixed write of 0xf0000000 to ring+0 by AppleMBX+0x1f58. r372
 * caught that same fixed store after packets beginning at +0 and +0x40, so
 * the earlier "rewrite this packet's header" interpretation was accidental:
 * packet zero merely aliases the doorbell.
 *
 * Between those writes the device has to remember where the copied command
 * began. Keep that state in the otherwise unread backing slot for STATUS:
 * s5l_mbx_read() serves the independent `status` field, so this marker is not
 * guest-visible, while snap_mbx() already serialises every reg[] word. That
 * preserves a snapshot taken between the command copy and the submit store
 * without changing the v32 format or stealing a real readable register.
 * r376 then caught two real multi-command submits: eight blended packets and
 * four simple copies were each followed by one fixed doorbell. Preserve both
 * the first ring word and the number of copied heads. A zero count is reserved
 * as the fail-closed overflow marker after 255 heads; the measured batches are
 * far smaller, and pretending to know where a larger one ends would be worse

/* r409-r412 initially supplied four literal app-icon/label forms. Reading the
 * shipped _mbx3DCtxQuadCopyPerspective producer explains the shared packet
 * instead: it is a BGRA8 textured sprite whose independently encoded
 * destination, UV, texture-power, pitch, clip and tile bounds must agree.
 *
 * The texture header stores log2(power-of-two dimension)-3 in nibbles 6 and 5.
 * Linear pitch is split because the source address consumes bits 0..17 of its
 * word: pitch_bytes/16 bits 2..7 remain in source-control bits 18..23, while
 * bit 1 is relocated to texture-header bit 0. All measured linear textures
 * use an eight-pixel padded pitch, and that reconstruction yields every
 * captured 0x40..0x500 stride exactly. r415 adds the producer's second vertex
 * order: control 0x0e uses full width/power and height/power UV extents, while
 * control 0x8e uses the previously recovered half-texel extents. QuartzCore's
 * transform_filter_bits path proves that the latter is its filtered form, and
 * the co-shipped software sampler supplies the clamped 8-bit bilinear kernel.
 * r420 then contributes one exact uniformly minified 320x460 form and a third
 * measured state pair. Both vertex orders redundantly encode the same
 * destination and are checked in full. r434 and r438 add the filtered affine
 * subset: the direct sampler remains rigid 1:1, while the modulated sampler may
 * apply a positive uniform similarity transform. The captured samplers carry
 * one uniform alpha byte, which uses the already recovered channel-modulation
 * equation. The background object, blend object and FBSTART must all resolve to
 * the same mapped target, but its GPU address is not a rendering semantic and
 * is therefore not whitelisted. This is still not a perspective or arbitrary
 * affine rasterizer: shear, nonuniform affine scale, four-point warps and
 * coloured vertices remain rejected. r416's partly off-screen label is
 * filtered only when its normalized coordinates, integer boundary, clip and
 * tiles all independently agree. */
