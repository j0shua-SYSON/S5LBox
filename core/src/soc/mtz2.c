/*
 * S5LBox — the multi-touch controller on spi1 chip select 0.
 *
 * /arm-io/spi1/multi-touch, `compatible "multi-touch,n82"`, reg[0] = 0 (the
 * chip select — there is no `chip-select` property anywhere in the shipped
 * tree), `interrupts {0x9b, 0}` = GPIO interrupt line 155, `function-reset`
 * GPIO 0x0606 and `function-power_ldo` GPIO 0x0701.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE ONE THING THAT MUST NOT BE GOT BACKWARDS
 * ===========================================================================
 * AppleMultitouchZ2SPI probes this device with isInHBPP() — 0xc0441008,
 * reached by virtual dispatch through slot 0x4d0 of the vtable at 0xc0449f40,
 * never by a direct bl — and TWO CALLERS WANT OPPOSITE ANSWERS:
 *
 *   finishStarting() 0xc0442670 takes `beq 0xc0442714` on FALSE, prints
 *   "Could not detect HBPP. Returning false from finishStarting()" and
 *   DETACHES. That is the state run61 measured against the null device and the
 *   whole reason this file exists. It needs TRUE.
 *
 *   attemptToBootloadDevice 0xc04414c4 probes first thing
 *   (`ldr pc,[r3,#0x4d0]` at 0xc04414dc). On TRUE it logs "attempting to
 *   bootload device" and pushes 54,156 bytes of firmware — run65 watched it
 *   reach "MTSPIBootloader_Z2::bootloadDevice() / sending preconstructed
 *   firmware bytes". On FALSE it logs "not in HBPP, so skipping bootload"
 *   (literal 0xc04486f0, referenced only from this function's pool at
 *   0xc04415e4) and returns 0 — which the retry loop at 0xc043a980 counts as
 *   one failure, printing "Bootload attempt %d of %d failed". It needs FALSE.
 *
 * The two sites are BYTE-IDENTICAL on the wire, so the discrimination has to be
 * stateful. It is one monotonic bit, `hbpp_answered`, and getting the state it
 * keys on right took four wrong designs and two boots:
 *
 *   1. "Watch the reset line: the bootload probe follows resetDevice(TRUE)."
 *      Both sites reset. Worthless as a discriminator on its own.
 *
 *   2. "Accept the first probe, decline the rest." MEASURED WRONG. A run with
 *      `--call-probe-kernel 0xc0441008 --call-probe-kernel 0xc0442670` shows
 *      finishStarting entered once, at instruction 220,700,146, and isInHBPP
 *      entered once, at 316,898,121 with lr = 0xc04426cc. But spi1 carried TWO
 *      byte-identical 16-byte `1A A1 18 E1…` transfers, at 309.53M and 316.91M.
 *      The first is resetDevice's DUMMY TRANSFER (0xc0440d7c builds the same
 *      sixteen bytes and logs "initiating dummy transfer"), whose answer is
 *      discarded. A plain probe counter spends itself there and hands
 *      finishStarting the rejection.
 *
 *   3. "Never decline, then." That is what shipped in 098ce49, and run65 showed
 *      where it leads: the bootload probe answered TRUE and the driver began
 *      pushing firmware. Correct behaviour for an unprogrammed part; not what
 *      this model can survive.
 *
 *   4. "A reset restores HBPP, so a reset must also re-arm the claim." No. The
 *      guest pulses this line at every site, so re-arming the claim makes site
 *      2 identical to site 1 — which is bug 3 again. A reset restores the
 *      part's STATE; it does not un-ask the question the host already asked.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY SEPARATES THE TWO EXCHANGES IS THE RESET LINE'S LEVEL, and the
 * guest's own log says so:
 *
 *      mtlog: enabling power
 *      mtlog: ensuring S_CLK is high
 *      mtlog: initiating dummy transfer      <- reset still ASSERTED
 *      mtlog: Deasserting reset line
 *      mtlog: checking if in HBPP            <- reset RELEASED
 *
 * confirmed against the GPIO trace to the instruction: fsel write 0x0006060e
 * (group 6, bit 6, level 0) at 220,635,069 asserts; the dummy runs at
 * 309.53M; 0x0006060f releases at 309,541,162; the probe runs at 316.91M;
 * 0x0006060e asserts again at 316,965,809. So the line is ACTIVE LOW, the
 * dummy is entirely inside the asserted window and the probe entirely outside
 * it.
 *
 * A part held in its reset pin drives nothing. Modelling that one physical
 * fact makes the dummy answer sixteen zeros — which the driver discards, as it
 * always did — and leaves `hbpp_answered` for the exchange that is actually
 * read. No magic constant, no counting of transfers, and every element of it
 * is visible in the guest's own log.
 *
 * `hbpp_answered` is still a lie: a real unprogrammed Z2 answers TRUE forever
 * and expects firmware. It is a bounded, named, single-bit lie that costs three
 * cosmetic log lines, and the alternative is in the note at the end of this
 * comment.
 *
 * ANSWERING TRUE ONCE ALSO CHOOSES THE FRAME OPCODE. The true return runs
 * `strb r3, [r4, #0x1bc]` at 0xc04426fc, and deviceReadResultData at
 * 0xc0441324 rejects 0xEB unless this+0x1bc is non-zero. So this device's Z2
 * frame opcode is downstream of the HBPP answer rather than independent of it.
 *
 * THE ALTERNATIVE, AND WHY NOT YET. Implementing the HBPP sink — accepting the
 * 54,156 bytes and afterwards reporting firmware resident — removes the lie
 * entirely.
 *
 * IT IS BLOCKED BY DMA AFTER ALL, and this paragraph used to say the opposite.
 * The old text read: "It is NOT blocked by DMA, which was the standing
 * objection: MTSPIBootloader_Z2 pushes through the ordinary SPI entry
 * `v[0x368]` at 0xc0444ff8, 0xc0445224 and 0xc04454d0." Those three sites are
 * real, and they are all in the CALIBRATION senders. The FIRMWARE sender is
 * 0xc0445144 and it has a fourth site the survey missed — `v[0x360]` at
 * 0xc04451ec — chosen at 0xc04451b0 on `bootloader->0x2c`, which the guest's
 * own console announces as "AppleMultitouchZ2SPI: using DMA for bootloading".
 *
 * run103 measured which arm is taken, and it is not close:
 *
 *     0xc04451c4  the DMA path        15 captures
 *     0xc04451ec  v[0x360], the DMA transfer   15
 *     0xc04451f4  the PIO path         0
 *     0xc0445224  v[0x368], the PIO transfer    0
 *
 * fifteen being three bootload attempts times the five retries each makes. The
 * transfer then RETURNS SUCCESS — 0xc044525c, the success branch, fires all
 * fifteen times — and the acknowledgement after it still does not answer
 * 0x4BC1. The device never saw the packet: its framer is still waiting for a
 * sixteen-octet probe, so it loops the `1A A1` back and the driver reads
 * 0x1AA1. That much is measured and stands.
 *
 * WHY the packet never arrives has been wrong twice, and both readings are
 * retracted here rather than quietly edited away.
 *
 *   - "core/src/soc/spi.c has no DMA path at all" was the first. The SPI model
 *     is not the obstacle: across every run the PL080 has refused nothing
 *     (`flow 0 width 0 chain 0 softreq 0 endian 0`), and soc.h documents
 *     /arm-io/spi1's asymmetric widths — four bytes in, one out — as modes it
 *     runs, while the shipped tree only ever uses flow control 0-3.
 *
 *   - "the SPI controller holds no DMA channel, so v[0x360] refuses with
 *     kIOReturnDMAError" was the second, and run112 killed it: the refusal at
 *     0xc05a69ec is captured ZERO times and the success path 41, with a real
 *     TX channel (0xc0e19400) in 40 of 41 calls. The RX channel is null, but
 *     the request never asks for RX DMA, which is correct for a sender.
 *
 * What is left is the transfer itself: the channel is aimed at SPI_TXDATA and
 * carries transfer size 0 with no Enable bit. Whether the controller's global
 * enable is ever written is being measured properly for the first time — the
 * old report inferred it from the register's resting value, which cannot tell
 * "never written" from "written and cleared".
 *
 * So the work is in the SPI controller, not here. What also blocks it is that
 * the bootloader's own multi-stage protocol is unread, its failure mode is a
 * hang inside commandSleep rather than an error, and the feedback loop is an
 * 18-minute boot because the timer does not fire until instruction 1.11e9. It
 * is a fidelity upgrade, not a prerequisite: nothing above the bootloader can
 * tell a part that was programmed from one that says it was.
 *
 * ===========================================================================
 * THE WIRE PROTOCOL
 * ===========================================================================
 * Full duplex, one byte out for one byte in, framed by length. Command frames
 * are 16 bytes:
 *
 *     [0]      opcode
 *     [1..4]   parameters (report id in [1] for 0xE3/0xE6/0xE7)
 *     [5..13]  zero
 *     [14..15] LE16 sum16 of [0..13]
 *
 * CONFIRMED at 0xc0443288-0xc044329c, which builds GET_REPORT_INFO as
 * `tx[0]=0xE3; tx[1]=id; tx[14..15] = LE16(0xE3 + id)` — the plain byte sum of
 * a buffer that memset zeroed, with no seed and no complement.
 *
 * The driver validates a response two ways and only two ways
 * (0xc04433e4-0xc0443438 for 0xE3, 0xc04409b8-0xc04409f0 for 0xE1):
 *
 *     rx[0] == tx[0]                      else kIOReturnNotResponding
 *     LE16(rx[14..15]) == sum16(rx, 14)   else an error
 *
 * Both are satisfied by answering IN THE SAME TRANSFER: byte 0 of the reply is
 * the byte being received at that instant, and every later byte can depend on
 * every byte already received — including the report id at [1], which arrives
 * one slot before the first byte of the reply that needs it. The driver sends
 * 0xE3 twice with an IODelay(0x19) between (0xc04432ec and 0xc0443378) and
 * reads only the second, so answering both identically is correct and the
 * two-phase shape costs this model nothing.
 *
 * WE NEVER VALIDATE THE HOST'S CHECKSUM, and that is not laziness. The
 * control-read stage-2 packet ships a STALE one: 0xc0441ff8 stores tx[2] = 1
 * and the transfer at 0xc0442030 follows with no recomputation, so the frame
 * carries sum16 computed while tx[2] was still zero. 0xE5 by contrast does
 * recompute. A checksum-strict device would reject every control read the
 * driver makes, and whether real silicon checks it cannot be decided from
 * driver code.

     *     units converts to a pixel by an exact integer divide with no
     *     rounding rule to get wrong.
     *   - 15 units per point is 1/15 of a pixel of headroom, so when a later
     *     step reports sub-pixel contact positions nothing here has to change.
     *   - It is within 2.5% of the real iPhone 3G active area (about 49.2 mm by
     *     73.8 mm), so anything that treats these as physical dimensions — a
     *     gesture recogniser converting to millimetres per second, say — gets a
     *     sane answer rather than an absurd one. A pair like 32000 x 48000

     *     320 mm wide phone.

 *
 * THE PAYLOAD FORMAT.
 *
 * The kext parses ONE byte of the payload — 0xc0438a1c tests
 * `payload[0] == 0x50` and diverts that case to a separate 8-byte status
 * decoder at 0xc043d1ac — and otherwise hands the buffer verbatim to
 * `IODataQueue::enqueue(payload, (len + 3) & ~3)`. Everything else is decided
 * by userspace, and the format below was read out of userspace by two
 * independent readers that were given the same question and no access to each
 * other's answer:
 *
 *   A. MultitouchSupport.framework's own parser, inside the shared cache at
 *      load address 0x33cf6000. `_mt_HandleMultitouchFrame` (0x33cfb3ec)
 *      switches on payload[0]; 0xCC and 0xCE go to `_MTProcess_0xCC_Data`
 *      (0x33cfba60).
 *   B. MultitouchHID.plugin, a different binary (VA == file offset), whose
 *      MTSimpleHIDManager consumes what A produces.
 *
 * They agree, independently, on: the dispatch being on payload[0]; the header
 * being counter / button state / contact count at [1] / [2] / [3]; the
 * per-contact stride of THIRTY-TWO for this frame type (`lsl r2, r3, #5` at
 * 0x33cfbbcc); the record beginning id / stage / fingerID / handID(s8); X as a
 * 32-bit value at +4 shifted right by 8 and Y the same at +8; Z total at +0x14;
 * the ellipse major and minor at +0x1c and +0x1e; coordinates in HUNDREDTHS OF
 * A MILLIMETRE, which is the same unit report 0xD9's surface size is already
 * published in; and the eight path stages 0..7 being NotTracking, StartInRange,
 * HoverInRange, MakeTouch, Touching, BreakTouch, LingerInRange, OutOfRange.
 *
 * Reader A additionally verified the byte-order selector, which settles a
 * question this file has carried as an open one since the geometry was chosen:
 * `_mt_SwapInt32DeviceToHost` (0x33cfb8e0) is `cmp r0,#1 / beq done / rev`,
 * with r0 taken from the device's cached `Endianness` property. So ONE means
 * "no swap" and every other value byte-swaps — and zero is NOT "native". The
 * model's `endianness = 1` is right, and it is right for a reason now rather
 * than by inheritance.
 *
 * WHY 0xCC AND NOT 0x44 OR 0x74. The parser accepts four contact-carrying
 * families and the device chooses by writing payload[0]; reader A's V2 (0x44)
 * table is the more capable one but only ONE reader produced it, while the
 * 0xCC record layout is what both readers derived separately. Where a wrong
 * guess costs an 18-minute boot, the doubly-attested shape is worth more than
 * the richer one. 0xCC also needs no negotiated header length and no stride
 * field: its header is a constant ten bytes and its stride a constant 32, so
 * there is no field whose default the two readings could differ about.
 *
 * WHAT REJECTS A FRAME, and it is a short list — there is no magic number and
 * no checksum anywhere in userspace: an unknown payload[0]; a length at or
 * below 9; a length below header + count * stride. Our shortest payload is
 * 10 + 32 = 42 bytes, and the kext rounds the enqueued length UP to a multiple
 * of four, so what userspace measures is 44 and both bounds hold with room.
 */

/* ================================================== the normaliser's bounds ===
 *
 * THE SURFACE A CONTACT IS MEASURED AGAINST IS NOT THE ONE REPORT 0xD9
 * PUBLISHES, and getting that backwards is what run98 measured.
 *
 * _mt_FillMTContactDirectFromBinary (0x33cfdac4) normalises each raw coordinate
 * as `(v - min) / (max - min)`, and the four bounds come from
 * _alg_InitRowColXYConvert (0x33d01010), which builds them out of the Sensor
 * Region Descriptor's electrode counts and never looks at 0xD9's width and
 * height at all. See s5l_mtz2_report()'s MTZ2_REPORT_REGION_DESC case for the
 * derivation and for what about it is not established; the two numbers this
 * device's 10 columns and 15 rows produce are:
 *
 *     x in [-75, 4656]     span 4731     14.784375 units per pixel across 320
 *     y in [-75, 7275]     span 7350     15.3125   units per pixel down   480
 *
 * TWO CONSEQUENCES, and the second is the reason this arithmetic changed rather
 * than only the descriptor:
 *
 *   - The spans are not equal, and neither is 15x the panel. The device's own
 *     two statements about its width — 4800 hundredths of a millimetre in
 *     report 0xD9 and 4731 implied by the descriptor — DISAGREE by 1.5%. That
 *     disagreement is real and is left visible rather than papered over: 0xD9's
 *     value has the exact-integer-scale property this file argues for at
 *     length, no consumer of it has been found on the boot path, and changing
 *     it would be a second unmeasured guess in the same breath as the first.
 *     The ellipse below still scales through 0xD9 for the same reason: it is a
 *     LENGTH in hundredths of a millimetre, which is precisely the quantity
 *     "Sensor Surface Width" names.
 *
 *   - Mapping the panel onto 0..4800 and then normalising against -75..4656
 *     does not merely offset the result, it runs OFF THE END. Pixel 319 came
 *     out at 4792, above an Xmax of 4656, so the clamp at 0x33d00f2c pinned it
 *     — the right five pixels of the screen were unreachable, on top of a ~+6
 *     px offset and a 1.5% stretch everywhere else. Mapping onto the bounds
 *     themselves removes all three at once.
