# Where the guest actually spends its instructions

Measured 2026-07-30. This file exists because the answer was recorded nowhere and
was assumed wrongly for weeks.

## The short version

The largest single expense is **verifying Apple's code signatures**, not drawing.

| slice | share of r195 | instructions |
|---|---|---|
| `_SHA1Init` (kernel, 5 KB blob) | 17.8% | ~880,000,000 |
| `[userspace]`, of which the top 16 PCs are one loop | 65.3% | — |
| everything else in the kernel | ~2% | nothing above 1.5% |

r195 retired 4,950,000,000 instructions and sampled every 1024, so a sample is
1024 instructions and the percentages are instruction shares, not time guesses.

## How the userspace bucket was opened

`diagnostic_pc_name()` prints every user-mode PC as the single literal
`[userspace]`, which is why 65.3% arrived under one name. The addresses were
always in the log; only the print depth was short (16 rows, since raised to 64).

All sixteen hottest PCs of **r187, r194 and r195 independently** fall inside one
88-byte span, `0x3145ad4c..0x3145ada4` — about twenty-two instructions, one loop,
each instruction carrying ~0.8% of all samples.

```

python tools/dscmap.py work/cache/dsc_armv6 0x3145ad4c --count 12
```

```

Its neighbours are `_SECOID_FindOID`, `_DEREncodeSequence`,
`_modg_via_recipSmall` and `_ginverseMod`: CryptKit giant-number arithmetic
beside ASN.1 DER and OID lookup. That is certificate and signature verification.

The shared cache maps at a fixed address in every iPhone OS 3 process, so a
userspace VA resolves without knowing which process was running.

## How much data SHA-1 is chewing

880 M instructions at roughly 1,200 Thumb instructions per 64-byte block is
~733,000 blocks, about **47 MB hashed in one run** — against a 96 MB shared
cache. Consistent with hashing code pages as they fault in: at boot, again at
each app launch, and again whenever memory pressure evicts a page and it faults
back.

A native SHA-1 costs ~10 host cycles/byte against the interpreter's ~19 guest
instructions/byte at 20-50 host cycles each. The slice does not shrink, it
effectively vanishes. Amdahl on 17.8% alone is **1.22x**.

## The SHA-1 site, bounded

```
./build-opt/core/machoinfo.exe firmware/kernel.macho -r <addr>
```

```
_SHA1Init                      0xc01704a8
_SHA1UpdateUsePhysicalAddress  0xc01718a4    <- next symbol
                               ---------
                               0x13fc = 5116 bytes
```

Only `SHA1Init` is exported; `SHA1Update`, `SHA1Final` and `SHA1Transform` are
local and have no symbols, so all 5 KB is attributed to `_SHA1Init`. The hot
offsets cluster near the end of the region, which is where Transform's 80-round
loop would sit. Sampled PCs there are odd, so the code is **Thumb**.

**Next step, and the reason no site is armed yet:** disassemble
`0xc01704a8..0xc01718a4` as Thumb with Capstone, find the `push` prologues, and
identify the `SHA1Update` and `SHA1Transform` entries. A prologue invented from
what a compiler "would" emit is not an identity check -- it is a guess that fails
open the first time it is wrong (see `tools/ios3_hle.c`). Both neighbouring
CoreGraphics sites needed four prologue words rather than two for exactly this
reason.

## What was ruled out, so it is not re-attempted

| hypothesis | verdict | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ARM decode chain is the cost | **refuted** | 10-position mixed loop 14.45 M insn/s vs 1-position 14.18, same sweep |
| MMU walk is the cost | refuted | off 14.18 / sections-1M 14.04 / pages-4K 14.10 |
| data-read caching helps | refuted | 95.15% hit rate, 1.004x wall clock |
| Thumb decoder is slower | refuted | Thumb is 1.46x *faster* on the same loop |
| CoreGraphics leaf HLE is the fps lever | refuted | run168: `CGBlt_fillBytes` 43 times across 75 composites |
| device tick is free | **false, still standing** | 16.8% (14.18 -> 11.80 with tick on) |

## The framing error underneath all of it

`docs/ROADMAP.md` row D justified the dynarec with "15-30 M insn/s against
250-370 needed for realtime". That comparison is wrong.

```
fps = host_instruction_rate / instructions_per_frame
```

Guest idle is free because WFI fast-forwards: `_machine_idle` is entered 23,799
times in r195 and does not appear in the profile at all. Executing a guest second
per host second was never the requirement; only per-frame work is. The
load-bearing unknown is **instructions per composited frame**, which r187 put a
floor under at 111,337 (its minimum gap between composites).
